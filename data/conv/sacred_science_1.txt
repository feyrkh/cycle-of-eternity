   The sacred sciences, used centuries ago to build the Shadow Aegis, include the study of the Light of Heaven and its effects on the souls of men, beasts and the world. Little is remembered from the peaks of knowledge which were scaled by the sages who built the Aegis and shielded us from Heaven's cruel gaze, but a summary of what is known follows.

1. The soul and its relationship to essence
   A soul is the essential nature of any single thing. While the soul of a man is different than that of a dog, which is different again from the soul of a tree, and different yet again from the soul of a mountain, Heaven's Light reacts similarly to each. Small amounts of Light may shine through a soul as though a ray of sunlight through stained glass, coloring the Light with the nature of the soul it passes through. Just as a red pane of glass will produce red light, the soul of a mountain will produce earth essence, while the soul of a river provides water essence. 

   Larger amounts of Light shining through a soul will burn away impurities, leading to physical and spiritual mutations. In animals and some plants this can result in the creation of dire beasts, while in humans it leads to madness as the subtleties which make a person 'human' melt away and the core of the soul is magnified and refined into something monstrous.
