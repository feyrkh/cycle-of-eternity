7. Advancement
   The first stage of advancement, opening the inner eye, is but the first step of a stairway that leads into eternity. While the later stages of advancement are losts to the mists of time, it is certain that we must rediscover the knowledge if Humanity is to survive the fall of the Shadow Aegis. One theory is that advancement requires filling an exemplar's core to the brim with essence, then somehow compressing the core into a denser form, but deeper insights must be attained before we know how this might be accomplished.
