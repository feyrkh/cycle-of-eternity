5. Storing aura
   Aura is stored within the exemplar's core, at the center of their soul. Because there is only one storage place for aura, one should be careful to avoid contamination of incompatible elements. For instance, water aura and fire aura react violently - the fire aura is slowly destroyed, causing physical and spiritual damage to the exemplar, and producing a sort of spiritual tar which builds up within the core and can severely limit the exemplar's capacity for aura storage until purified.

   Once stored within the core, aura may be released into the body. Special breathing techniques are typically used for this. The simplest techniques release a single element of aura in an uncontrolled fashion, while more advanced techniques may provide two or even three aura sources at once in specific patterns.
