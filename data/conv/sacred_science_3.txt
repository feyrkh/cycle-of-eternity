3. Exemplars
   When applied by a human the sacred science results in an exemplar. They are so named because the sacred science requires the practitioner to be near the peak of human performance in all aspects - physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Weakness in any aspect of an exemplar's being risks being magnified by Heaven's Light, and will in any case result in barriers to progression.

   A disciple of the sacred science's first duty is to train themselves to their peak condition. Then they should meditate on the nature of Heaven while bathing their body in a source of Light - ideally the strongest their spirit can withstand, but we currently have only a single source, the crack in Shell Zero of the Aegis. At some point they will have an epiphany - an insight which can be used to guide their soul toward advancement. The nature of the epiphany will partially determine the shape their soul takes, but in any case they will unlock their inner eye, allowing them to control essence as it streams through their body.
