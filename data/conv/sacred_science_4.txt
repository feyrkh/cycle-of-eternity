4. Condensing essence
   Essence, being a form of Heavenly Light, is too insubstantial to use for anything. The heart of the sacred science, therefore, is condensing essence into a more tangible form, called aura. Aura is akin to a gaseous form of essence, and it may be generated via a focused effort of will within the soul of any living being. When aura is generated by beasts, we call them sacred beasts. They see physical changes, though often not of the magnitude associated with dire beasts, and may develop unnatural cunning or even true intelligence as they advance their mastery of aura.

   When an exemplar gains the insight needed to control essence, their soul and body begin reacting to essence. In some ways their body is frozen in place - an exemplar at the first stage of enlightenment will never grow weaker than they were when they opened their inner eye. In others, they are improved - the upper bound of their capabilities is expanded in ways that depend on their current level of fitness and the precise epiphany they used to open their inner eye. The most profound change is the ability to condense essence.

   When viewed through their inner eye, the exemplar will see essence streaming through their body. Using special breathing techniques, hand signs, mental foci, medicines, sacred artifacts, and so on, they will be able manipulate the flow of essence. Typically a mental focus will open one or more gates within the user's body, while breathing techniques and hand signs will affect the movement of essence and aura. Meditating on the insight gained earlier will open a condensation gate. Passing essence over this gate will drain a portion of the essence, converting it into aura within the exemplar's soul.
