6. Using stored aura
   Before stored aura may be used, exemplars must gain insight into a technique which will allow them to use the aura. Insights may come from any activity - physical training is a common trigger, as well as combat. Meditation is the most reliable way to gain insights, especially when meditating upon sources of strong essence, but may be time-consuming. Even leisure activities may result in insight that leads to unlocking a technique. 

   Upon activating a technique, one or more gates will appear within the exemplar's body. These gates must be first be opened with the help of mental foci, hand signs, or other meditation aids. Finally, the gates must be fueled with aura from your core. The more aura you can supply, the stronger the technique will be, with each gate providing some specific benefit. The faster you can supply the aura, the quicker the technique will be to trigger in combat. The more difficult any breathing techniques or mental foci you use, the more strain you will put on your body, mind and soul - this can lead to fatigue, slowness, loss of self-control, and other side effects if a technique stresses the exemplar beyond their ability to withstand the stress.
