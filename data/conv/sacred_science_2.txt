2. Kinds of essence
   Elemental essence is believed to be the easiest to sense and manipulate, but our sacred scientists suspect that more rarified kinds of essence may also exist - there are fragmentary references to "sword essence", "shadow essence", and even "dream essence" in our oldest surviving documents. Each kind of essence is useful for different tasks - water essence is naturally soothing and healing, while fire essence is ideal for wanton destruction. It is believed that a sacred scientist with sufficient skill may bend the elements to their will in startling ways, however.
