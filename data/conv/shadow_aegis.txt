As the incandescent Sun shines its light upon the body of the world, so too does the eternal Light of Heaven shine upon the soul of the world.

As the life-giving Sun sustains our crops during good times, so too does the mutable Light of Heaven sublimate the soul of the world into elemental essence.

As the fierce Sun bakes the ground into cracked ruin during bad times, so too does the malevolent Light of Heaven twist beasts and men into abominations.

As the distant Sun may be hidden by the clouds, so are we sheltered from the cruel Light of Heaven by the Shadow Aegis.

Forged by great sages uncounted centuries ago, the Shadow Aegis surrounds the Empire of Humanity in concentric shells which shade us from the sight of Heaven. The innermost shell contains our entire known world. While it allows light from the Sun to pass, it prevents the passage of men and beasts. Most importantly, each layer of the Aegis filters out the Light of Heaven, a bit more at each layer. By the time it reaches the innermost shell, the Light is too weak to burn our souls. In this manner, Humanity has been kept safe since the Aegis' construction. 

Our sacred scientists, those who have devoted their lives to understanding the workings of the Shadow Aegis, have found something disturbing in recent months, however - a crack in the Aegis. Too small to allow a man to pass, they yet fear that the tiniest measure of Heaven's Light may be shining through. Worse, the crack is expanding. Slowly - less than a hair's breadth each day - but if the Aegis were to fail entirely then the Light-corrupted dire beasts that live between the innermost shell, Shell Zero, and the next, Shell One, would be free to wreak havoc upon the Empire. For this reason, the Emperor has commanded the creation of a school for sacred science near the crack in Shell Zero.
